# Economic Analysis: "Lightning Goats" Revenue Impact
## Project: Discover AES Rackmount Upgrade (25.6 kWh)

The addition of the "Lightning Goats" revenue stream fundamentally changes the financial nature of this upgrade. By generating **$1,000 per year**, the battery bank transitions from a "Backup Power Expense" to a **"Profit-Generating Asset."**

Below is the 15-year projection, based on the **5-Unit Rackmount Configuration**.

---

### 1. The Financial Baseline

*   **Estimated Project Cost:** **~$13,500**
    *   *Hardware:* ~$9,500 (5x Batteries, Combiner, Gateway, Racks, Cables).
    *   *Labor/Misc:* ~$4,000 (Removal of old lead-acid, installation, custom cabling).
*   **Projected Lifespan:** **15 Years**
    *   *Limited by:* Calendar aging of electronics/chemistry (not cycle life).

### 2. The "Goat Revenue" Offset

*   **Annual Revenue:** $1,000
*   **15-Year Total Revenue:** **$15,000**

### 3. Net Cost Calculation

$$ \text{Total Project Cost} - \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Net Cost} $$

$$ \$13,500 - \$15,000 = \mathbf{-\$1,500} $$

**Result:** The "Lightning Goats" completely pay for the new battery bank, plus they generate a **$1,500 surplus** over the life of the system.

### 4. Return on Investment (ROI)

*   **Payback Period:** **13.5 Years**.
    *   It will take ~13.5 years for the goats to fully pay off the initial investment.
    *   Years 14 and 15 are pure profit.
*   **Operational Security:**
    *   Upgrading to Lithium in 2027 ensures the "Goat Feeder" never shuts down due to voltage sag or sulfated batteries, securing that income stream.

### 5. Strategic Conclusion

**Proceed with the upgrade in August 2027.**

The move to **Rackmount** batteries (vs. the older Wall-mount style) significantly improved the ROI of this project. We are now getting **25.6 kWh** of capacity for roughly the same price as the original 22 kWh plan, further lowering the cost per kWh stored.
