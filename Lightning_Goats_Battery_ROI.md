# Economic Analysis: "Lightning Goats" Revenue Impact
## Project: Discover AES Rackmount Upgrade (25.6 kWh)

The addition of the "Lightning Goats" revenue stream fundamentally changes the financial nature of this upgrade. By generating **$1,000 per year**, the battery bank transitions from a "Backup Power Expense" to a **"Profit-Generating Asset."**

Below is the 15-year projection, based on the **5-Unit Rackmount Configuration**, compared against the alternative of connecting to the Grid.

### 1. The Financial Baseline (Solar Upgrade)

*   **Estimated Project Cost:** **~$13,500**
    *   *Hardware:* ~$9,500 (5x Batteries, Combiner, Gateway, Racks, Cables).
    *   *Labor/Misc:* ~$4,000 (Removal of old lead-acid, installation, custom cabling).
*   **Projected Lifespan:** **15 Years**
    *   *Limited by:* Calendar aging of electronics/chemistry (not cycle life).

### 2. The "Goat Revenue" Offset

*   **Annual Revenue:** $1,000
*   **15-Year Total Revenue:** **$15,000**

### 3. Net Cost Calculation (Solar Only)

$$ \text{Total Project Cost} - \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Net Cost} $$

$$ \$13,500 - \$15,000 = \mathbf{-\$1,500} $$

**Result:** The "Lightning Goats" completely pay for the new battery bank, plus they generate a **$1,500 surplus** over the life of the system.

### 4. The "Grid Connection" Comparison
*Alternative Scenario: Connecting to Sangre Electric Cooperative.*

If you were to abandon the off-grid lifestyle and connect to the grid, the "Lightning Goats" revenue would still exist, but it would be consumed by the cost of the grid connection.

**A. Upfront Infrastructure**
*   **Line Extension / Hookup:** **$16,000** (Conservative Estimate).
    *   *Note: This is "Money out the door" just to get a meter on the wall.*

**B. Recurring Costs (15 Years)**
*   **Daily Usage:** ~5.3 kWh/day ($0.95/day).
*   **Monthly System Access Fee:** ~$22.00/month (Standard Coop Fixed Charge).
*   **Annual Grid Bill:** ~$612.00 per year.
*   **15-Year Energy Cost:** **$9,180** (assuming no rate increases).

**C. Net Grid Cost Calculation**
$$ (\text{Hookup} + \text{Energy Bills}) - \text{Goat Revenue} = \text{Net Cost} $$
$$ (\$16,000 + \$9,180) - \$15,000 = \mathbf{\$10,180} $$

**Result:** Even with the goat revenue, connecting to the grid results in a **$10,180 loss** over 15 years.

### 5. Final Verdict: Solar vs. Grid

| Metric | **Off-Grid (Solar + Goats)** | **Grid Tie (Sangre Electric)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upfront Cost** | $13,500 | $16,000+ |
| **15-Year Operating Cost** | $0 (Sun is free) | $9,180 |
| **15-Year Revenue** | +$15,000 | +$15,000 |
| **NET 15-YEAR POSITION** | **+$1,500 (Profit)** | **-$10,180 (Cost)** |

**The "Opportunity Cost" of Switching:**
By staying off-grid and upgrading our batteries, we are **$11,680 wealthier** over the next 15 years compared to connecting to the grid.

### 6. Strategic Conclusion

**Proceed with the upgrade in August 2027.**

*   **Financial Logic:** The Solar option ends in the green (profit), while the Grid option ends in the red (cost).
*   **Resilience:** You maintain immunity from grid outages/blackouts.
*   **Value:** Even though the Grid option also benefits from the revenue, the high upfront hookup fees and monthly bills consume all the profit and then some.
