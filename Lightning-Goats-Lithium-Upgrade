# Project: Lightning Goats Lithium Upgrade (Solar Only)
**Target Date:** October 1, 2027 (depnding on existing system condition)
**Site Condition:** Off-Grid / Earthship / **NO GENERATOR**

---

## 1. Physical Constraints & Site Data
*   **Battery Box Dimensions:**
    *   **Width:** 48 inches (4 feet)
    *   **Depth:** 36 inches (3 feet)
    *   **Height:** **24 inches (2 feet) - CRITICAL LIMIT**
*   **Location/Access:**
    *   **Site Type:** Earthship (Concrete Floors).
    *   **Cleanliness:** Rugged environment. Work boots some mud are acceptable.
    *   **Distance to Inverter:** Approx 6 feet from access point.
*   **Existing Removal:**
    *   **Equipment:** 16x Fullriver DC400-6 AGM Batteries.
    *   **Total Weight:** **~1,972 lbs** (approx. 1 Ton).
    *   **Task:** Manual removal and disposal/recycling.

## 2. Division of Labor (Collaborative)
*   **Owner:**
    *   **Can** handle Firmware Updates (Gateway, Inverter, Batteries).
    *   **Can** handle LYNK II Gateway configuration & Closed-Loop setup.
    *   **Will** handle integration with Home Automation (OpenHAB/Modbus).
    *   *Goal:* Work alongside the installer during commissioning to ensure network settings align with existing IT infrastructure.
*   **Contractor:**
    *   **Removal:** Physical removal of 2,000 lbs of old lead-acid batteries.
    *   **Install:** Physical installation of new racks/batteries.
    *   **Wiring:** Custom DC Cabling (cutting & crimping the split-stack interconnects).
    *   **Hookup:** Connecting existing main inverter cables to the new Combiner Box.

## 3. Hardware Bill of Materials
*   **Core Storage:** 5x Discover AES Rackmount (`48-48-5120` Standard).
    *   *Total Capacity: 25.6 kWh.*
*   **Hub:** 1x AES Battery Module Combiner (`950-0049`).
*   **Comms:** 1x LYNK II Gateway (`950-0025`).
*   **Mounting:** 6x Quick Stack Rack Bracket Sets (`950-0050`).

## 4. Installation Layout (The "Split Stack")
*To fit within the **24-inch height limit** and **48-inch width limit**, the system must be installed as two side-by-side stacks.*

*   **Left Stack:** 3 Batteries High (Height: ~21.3").
*   **Right Stack:** 2 Batteries + 1 Combiner Box (Height: ~21.3").
*   **Interconnects (Contractor Task):**
    *   Requires **3 Pairs** of custom-length 4 AWG cables (approx 4-5 ft) to connect the Left Stack batteries to the Combiner.
    *   Requires 1x CAT5e cable to bridge data between stacks.
*   **Main Connection:**
    *   **Reuse Existing 4/0 AWG Cables.**
    *   Contractor to connect existing cables (currently on AGM posts) to the main lugs of the new Combiner Box.

## 5. Contractor Interview Checklist (Pass/Fail)

**Crucial Logistics (No Generator):**
1.  **"Since I have NO GENERATOR, will you bench-charge the new batteries to 100% at your shop? If they arrive at 30% charge, I cannot power my home that night."**
    *   *(Pass: Yes / Fail: No)*

**Technical Competence:**
2.  **"Do you have hydraulic crimpers on the truck? I have a split-stack layout that requires custom 4 AWG cables made on-site."**
    *   *(Pass: Yes / Fail: We only use pre-made cables.)*

**Site Logistics:**
3.  **"It's an Earthship with concrete floors, so you don't need to baby the floor, but are you equipped to hand-truck 2,000 lbs of batteries out of the structure?"**

**Scope of Work:**
4.  **"I can handle the firmware and networking myself, but I'd like to work *with* you during the configuration. Can you quote me primarily for the removal, installation, and DC wiring, with a collaborative hour for commissioning, education?"**

## 6. Budget Estimate
*   **Hardware Cost:** ~$9,200 – $10,000
*   **Labor Estimate (Removal + Install):** ~$2,500 – $4,000
*   **Total Project Budget:** **~$12,500 – $14,500**
